    <p>Ever wondered how cute your dog would look with a crown? Or your cat with a scarf? Accessorize without the hassles of bites and scratches; Vanity Fur is a dress-your-pet app built with Javascript and JQuery that allows the user to dress up their pet of choice with selected accessories. I created and designed the images for the pets and accessories.</p>
